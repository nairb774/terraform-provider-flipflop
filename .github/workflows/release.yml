# This GitHub action can publish assets for release when a tag is created.
# NOTE: This workflow is now primarily handled by semantic-release.yml which runs
# on push to main. This workflow is kept as a backup for manual releases.
#
# This uses an action (hashicorp/ghaction-import-gpg) that assumes you set your
# private key in the `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` secret and passphrase in the `PASSPHRASE`
# secret. If you would rather own your own GPG handling, please fork this action
# or use an alternative one for key handling.
#
# You will need to pass the `--batch` flag to `gpg` in your signing step
# in `goreleaser` to indicate this is being used in a non-interactive mode.
